		<p><strong>#1:</strong> Bayern Munich won the Champions League, German Bundesliga, and the German Cup this season. They are one of very few teams that have been financially self-sufficient for a while now. Now that they're winning everything, it makes sense for other teams to look into their model. I'd like to look at "financial fair play", a new rule the UEFA Champions League is going to enforce starting next season. I'll use statistics from <a href="http://www.transfermarkt.com">transfermarkt.com</a> to compare what all Champions League teams have spent and earned over the last 10 years. The question is: How far off are the clubs from flipping the switch and making sure they don't spend more money on players as they can earn back in revenue?</p>
		<p><strong>#2:</strong> Using data from <a href="http://basketballreference.com/">basketballreference.com</a> and <a href="http://stats.nba.com/?GameScope=Playoffs&PlayerOrTeam=Player&StatCategory=Points">NBA.com</a>, (and possibly other Fantasy-Basketball info sites, I have to research some more), I would like to ask the question: How likely is each pick of the NBA draft to turn into a maximum level player? I'll go through the last 20 years to analyze what percentage of each pick turned into a player that earned a maximum contract later in his career.</p>
		<p><strong>#3 (the wild one):</strong> This one I'm just throwing out there, because <a href="http://yankeeadler.tumblr.com/">I'm doing the Mongol Rally this summer</a>, and I'd love to do something regarding that project, I don't know if the dataset exists... I'd contact the event's organizors <a href="http://www.theadventurists.com/">The Adventurists</a>, to find out about stats how many teams have joined every year, and how many have made it, and where their cars broke down. I'd then try to pair it with other datasets I'll dig up about all the countries on the route regarding their road conditions/HDI/type of government/something like that.. this one needs to be hased out more, but I'm kind of intrigued if I get the right data...</p>
